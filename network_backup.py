🟣 1️⃣ Imports
python
Copy
Edit
import paramiko
import time
import re
✅ paramiko is the SSH library (for Python).
✅ time is used for timeouts and sleep loops.
✅ re is for regular expressions (prompt matching etc.).

Why?
Paramiko gives you programmatic SSH. It can open an interactive shell session on the agg-switch, just like you would manually.

🟣 2️⃣ User Configuration Section
python
Copy
Edit
AGG_IP = "192.168.1.1"           # The aggregation switch (jump host)
USERNAME = "admin"
PASSWORD = "cisco"
TARGET_SWITCHES = [
    "10.1.1.2",
    "10.1.1.3",
    "10.1.1.4",
]
TIMEOUT = 10
MAX_READ = 65535
✅ These variables define all your inputs:

AGG_IP – IP address of the aggregation switch. Your PC only connects to this.

USERNAME/PASSWORD – SSH credentials. Used for the agg-switch and also when hopping to target switches.

TARGET_SWITCHES – List of IPs of the switches whose configs you want.

TIMEOUT – How long to wait for prompts.

MAX_READ – How much data to buffer from SSH output.

🟣 3️⃣ expect_prompt() function
python
Copy
Edit
def expect_prompt(shell, patterns=("#", ">"), timeout=TIMEOUT):
    buf, end = "", time.time() + timeout
    while time.time() < end:
        if shell.recv_ready():
            data = shell.recv(MAX_READ).decode("utf-8", "ignore")
            buf += data
            for p in patterns:
                if p in buf:
                    return buf
        else:
            time.sleep(0.1)
    return buf
✅ Purpose:
Waits for the CLI prompt in an interactive shell.

✅ How it works:

Continuously reads SSH output.

Appends data to buf.

Checks if any of the patterns (e.g. #, >, assword:) is seen in the output.

Returns the entire buffer when it sees the prompt.

✅ Why?
You can't just "send a command and hope it finishes". You have to know when the switch CLI is ready for the next command. This waits until it sees a known prompt.

🟣 4️⃣ send_cmd()
python
Copy
Edit
def send_cmd(shell, cmd, patterns=("#", ">"), timeout=TIMEOUT):
    shell.send(cmd + "\n")
    return expect_prompt(shell, patterns, timeout)
✅ Purpose:
Sends a command to the interactive shell, and waits for the prompt.

✅ How it works:

Sends the command (with newline).

Calls expect_prompt() to wait until the switch finishes and shows prompt again.

Returns all output (including command echo and results).

✅ Why?
So you can sequentially automate CLI commands like:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
ssh -l admin 10.1.1.2
<wait for password prompt>
password
<wait for prompt>
enable
password
terminal length 0
show running-config
🟣 5️⃣ connect_to_agg()
python
Copy
Edit
def connect_to_agg():
    print(f"[CONNECT] SSH to aggregation switch: {AGG_IP}")
    client = paramiko.SSHClient()
    client.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())
    client.connect(AGG_IP, username=USERNAME, password=PASSWORD,
                   look_for_keys=False, allow_agent=False, timeout=10)
    shell = client.invoke_shell()
    expect_prompt(shell, ("#", ">"))
    send_cmd(shell, "enable", patterns=("assword:", "#"))
    send_cmd(shell, PASSWORD, patterns=("#",))
    send_cmd(shell, "terminal length 0", patterns=("#",))
    return client, shell
✅ Purpose:
Log in to the aggregation switch from your PC, and prepare the CLI for use.

✅ Step by step:
1️⃣ Creates SSH client and ignores missing host key checks.
2️⃣ Connects using AGG_IP, USERNAME, PASSWORD.
3️⃣ Invokes an interactive shell.
4️⃣ Waits for initial prompt.
5️⃣ Enters enable mode (and handles password prompt).
6️⃣ Turns off paging with terminal length 0.

✅ Why?
This sets up your jump host session, so you can issue commands from within the agg-switch CLI to hop to other switches.

🟣 6️⃣ get_running_config()
python
Copy
Edit
def get_running_config(shell, target_ip):
    ...
✅ Purpose:
SSH from inside the agg-switch CLI to the target switch, run show running-config, and capture the output.

✅ Detailed steps:

➜ A. SSH from agg-switch to target
python
Copy
Edit
out = send_cmd(shell, f"ssh -l {USERNAME} {target_ip}", ...)
Runs Cisco CLI command:

nginx
Copy
Edit
ssh -l admin 10.1.1.2
Expects prompts for "yes/no", "password", errors, #, >.

➜ B. Handle host-key confirmation
python
Copy
Edit
if "(yes/no)?" in out or "yes/no" in out:
    out = send_cmd(shell, "yes", ...)
Answers "yes" if asked to confirm the remote SSH key.

➜ C. Handle password prompt
python
Copy
Edit
if "assword:" in out:
    out = send_cmd(shell, PASSWORD, ...)
Sends the password when prompted.

➜ D. Enter enable mode if needed
python
Copy
Edit
if out.strip().endswith(">"):
    send_cmd(shell, "enable", ...)
    send_cmd(shell, PASSWORD, ...)
If landed in user-exec mode (>), promotes to enable mode (#).

➜ E. Disable paging on target
python
Copy
Edit
send_cmd(shell, "terminal length 0", ...)
Avoids --More-- pagination when collecting large configs.

➜ F. Run show running-config
python
Copy
Edit
running_config = send_cmd(shell, "show running-config", ...)
Gets the entire configuration output.

➜ G. Exit back to aggregation switch
python
Copy
Edit
send_cmd(shell, "exit", ...)
Closes the CLI SSH session to target, returning to agg-switch prompt.

✅ Returns the entire running-config output as a single string.

🟣 7️⃣ Main script block
python
Copy
Edit
if __name__ == "__main__":
    client, shell = connect_to_agg()

    for target in TARGET_SWITCHES:
        ...
    client.close()
    print("\n✅ All backups completed.")
✅ Purpose:

Establishes SSH connection from your PC to the agg-switch.

Opens the interactive shell.

Loops over each target switch in the list.

Calls get_running_config() to SSH hop from agg → target, run commands, and get config.

Saves output to a local text file.

Closes the SSH session at the end.

➜ Target loop
python
Copy
Edit
for target in TARGET_SWITCHES:
    ...
Iterates over your list of switches.

➜ Calling get_running_config
python
Copy
Edit
config_output = get_running_config(shell, target)
Runs the entire hopping logic.

➜ Saving to file
python
Copy
Edit
fname = f"{target.replace('.', '_')}_running_config.txt"
with open(fname, "w") as f:
    f.write(config_output)
Replaces dots in IP with underscores for filenames.

Saves config output to uniquely named text file.

➜ Error Handling
python
Copy
Edit
except Exception as e:
    print(f"[ERROR] Failed to backup {target}: {e}")
Catches and logs errors per target, without stopping the whole process.

✅ Example File Output
For switch 10.1.1.2, you'd get:

Copy
Edit
10_1_1_2_running_config.txt
containing the full show running-config output.
